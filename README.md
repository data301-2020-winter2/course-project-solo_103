## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My interest with this data set is exploring what aspects of each genre make them unique and to compare and contrast different musical and lyrical themes. I find this specifically interesting as genres tend to have stereotypes, for example violence tends to get associated more with metal or rap then genres like country or jazz. My goals with this data set are to explore these associations and compare with the data collected from an unobjective source, which in this case itâ€™s the computer program analyzing the songs. My questions that may want to ask regarding this data set could be what genre is the happiest, what genre is the most depressing, or how does the reputation of a genre compare to the calculated data. I think this data would make a good dashboard as music tends to be a topic most people are somewhat interested in, and the nature of the data set makes it very easy to compare genres or decades.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set describes different songs from different genres ranging from 1950 to 2019. Each genre has a set sample size which covers from when the genre was created to 2019, each year is represented somewhat equally, however, there seems to be a slightly stronger emphasis on the years of which the genre was most popular. A program was used to run through the lyrics and music of each song listed and analyzes them. the program then rates each song with a ranking from 0 to 1 in each category, these categories describe musical and lyrical themes within music such as; loudness, acousticness, violence, and sadness. There are 23 columns of criteria for each song, as well as the title, year, length, artist, genre, and the lyrics.  The data set contains 28372 songs and no data is missing.
